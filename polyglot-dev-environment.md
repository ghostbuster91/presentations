# Polyglot Development Environment

_This talk represents a generalized and updated version of one of [my previous talks](./nvim-scala.md)._

Modern software development is rarely limited to a single programming language. The evolution of technology and the demands of AI have necessitated developers to work with various programming languages, configurations, and tools built upon diverse software stacks. The days when proficiency in just one technology, such as Java, was sufficient seem to be inevitably over. Now, more than ever, there is a pressing need for robust IDE support.

While tools like IntelliJ IDEA and VS Code are continually improving, they do have limitations. In this presentation, I aim to showcase an alternative approach that I use in my day-to-day scala job: a method that harnesses modern tools such as Nix, direnv, LSP, Tree-sitter, and Neovim to create a consistent, polyglot developer environment. This environment can be easily versioned and replicated, offering a solution to the challenges faced in contemporary software development.
