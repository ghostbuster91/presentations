Keyboard layout tinkering

Recently I decided to improve the ergonomy of my workplace(home), which lead me to a discovery of the rabbit hole of custom keyboards.
After a few months of research, it turned out that is not even a rabbit hole but a real mine shaft straight to hell.
During this presentation I will tell you why I decided to switch to colemak, what are the pros and cons of using a different layout,
what happened to all my keybindings, what are space cadet and autoshift, and how I ended up using only 42 keys of my 54-keys keyboard.

I gave that talk on the following conferences:

- 298 Warsaw Java User group meetup
  - slides: https://slides.com/kasperkondzielski-1/keyboard-layout-tinkering
